## Operating Systems Course - DIEF UNIMORE ##

In this exercise we will implement a login function (login.c). 
At boot (see init.c), and each time the shell is closed, the user is presented 
with a login request (username, password). If successful, the home directory 
is created (i.e., /home/username), and a shell is launched. 
Usernames and passwords have to be stored in a separate file (shadow).

Good work!
